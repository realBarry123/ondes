    "Ondes was my attempt at making music that was equally accessible to everyone. Playable on any combination of devices, from anywhere with internet access, and without a score, it removes the usual requirements for instruments and musical knowledge. ",
    "To further level the playing field, I employed an array of unfamiliar, often mysterious interfaces, labels, and sounds. The inaccessibility of the music becomes another equalizer, confounding musicians and non-musicians alike. ",
    "The title, “Ondes”, means “waves” in French and comes from the Ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument used extensively by Olivier Messiaen, from whom the aesthetic of the music draws inspiration. ",
    "As the piece is put into motion, it relies on the sending and receiving of invisible “ondes” (radio waves) through the air. ",
    "I don’t understand this technology, and as far as I’m concerned, no one does. "
